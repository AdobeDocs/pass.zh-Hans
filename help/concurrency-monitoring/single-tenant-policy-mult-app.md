# 为单个租户/策略和多个应用程序实施CM {#imp-cm}



## 用例

程序员P有一个iPhone应用程序、一个iPad应用程序和一个网站。 它需要与Adobe并发监控(CM)集成以限制这些应用程序之间的并发流数量。 程序员将创建限制并发使用的策略。 我们将查看两个示例：

第一个策略包含一条规则，该规则最多允许2个并发流。 将允许播放最新的流。
第二个策略包含两个规则。 它最多允许3个并发流（不超过2台设备），并且允许播放最新流。


## 具有一个规则的策略

我们的第一个策略包含一条规则：最多允许2个并发流，如果正在播放三个并发流，则第一个要启动的流将停止。

两个应用程序+一个网站用于启动流：

1. 用户从iPhone应用程序开始一个流，并从iPad应用程序开始一个流。 政策允许这一点。
1. 然后，用户从程序员网站启动第三个流。
1. 策略中的规则（最多2个流，最新的wins）允许播放最新的流，因此&#x200B;**已启动的第一个流将标记为与策略不兼容，并将停止。**

Figure 1: Policy with one rule

 

A Policy with two Rules
The policy contains the following two rules: 

no more than 3 concurrent streams are allowed, the first stream to start will be stopped in case more than three concurrent streams are playing;
no more than 2 devices are allowed to play streams. The stream from the first device will be stopped in case streams are running from 3 devices.
 

In this use case two apps are used to start streams:

The user starts two streams (s1, s2) from the iPhone app which is installed on two different devices (dev1, dev2) and the policy permits it.
The user then starts a third stream from an iPad (dev3).
The rules in the policy allow the stream to start.
When the first stream will check its state, the second rule (max 2 devices, latest wins) will mark it as non-compliant with the policy and will stop playback.

Prerequisites
In order to integrate with CM, a Zendesk ticket (https://adobeprimetime.zendesk.com) will have to be created and the following information specified:

the name of the company
the applications you want to integrate with CM. For each application, you are required to provide:
application name
application platform
the policy you want to enforce
 

After creating the ticket, the following information will be released for use:

Workflows
 



Figure 3: Concurrency Monitoring Workflows (described below)

 

1. Concurrency Monitoring allows playback
Step    APIs    Description    Comments
1    N/A    user starts video playback    
Prerequisites:

user is authenticated with an MVPD

2    API call: Session initialization    the app/player calls CM to initiate a stream    the app/player sends all required metadata using information from Adobe Pass Authentication
3    CM responds with decision and streamId    
the streamId json node value is stored by the application for the duration of the video playback

the policyCompliant json node has the value true so the app/player starts playback

the heartbeat url is returned by the call as a JSON Hypertext Application Language(HAL) template

4    N/A    the app/player starts video playback    N/A
5    API call: Heartbeat call - event=alive    the app/player reports alive heartbeats every x seconds    
the x value is specified by Adobe in the Zendesk ticket at integration

the url to report heartbeats is taken from the response of the start stream call and the value for the event param is alive

6    API call: Check Stream Compliance    the app/player checks the stream status every n seconds    
the n value is specified by Adobe in the Zendesk ticket at integration

stream status check is performed to validate that Adobe Concurrency Monitoring is allowing playback

7    CM responds with decision to continue playback    the policyCompliant json node has value true so the app/player continues playback
8    N/A    the app/player continues to show the video stream to the user    N/A
9    API call - Heartbeat call - alive=stop    the app/player sends stop heartbeat when the video finishes    the url to report heartbeats is taken from the response of the start stream call and the value for the event param is stop
 

Steps 5,6,7,8 will be performed in a loop until the video stream is stopped.

 

 

2. Concurrency Monitoring denies playback after stream is started
Step    APIs    Description    Comments
1    N/A    user starts video playback    
Prerequisites:

user is authenticated with an MVPD

2    API call: Session initialization    the app/player calls CM to initiate a stream    the app/player send all required metadata using information from Adobe Pass Authentication
3    CM responds with decision and streamId    
the streamId json node value is stored by the application for the duration of the video playback

the policyCompliant json node has value true so the app/player starts playback

the heartbeat url is returned by the call as a JSON Hypertext Application Language(HAL) template

4    N/A    the app/player starts video playback    N/A
5    API call: Heartbeat call - event=alive    the app/player reports alive heartbeats every x seconds    
the x value is specified by Adobe in the Zendesk ticket at integration

the url to report heartbeats is taken from the response of the start stream call and the value for the event param isalive

6    API call: Check Stream Compliance    the app/player checks the stream status every n seconds    
the n value is specified by Adobe in the Zendesk ticket at integration

stream status check is performed to validate that Adobe Concurrency Monitoring is allowing playback

7    CM responds with decision to stop playback    the policyCompliant json node has value false so the app/player stops playback
8    N/A    the app/player stops the video stream and displays an error to the user    N/A
9    API call - Heartbeat call - alive=stop    the app/player sends a stop heartbeat    the url to report heartbeats is taken from the response of the start stream call and the value for the event param is stop
 
3. Concurrency Monitoring doesn't allow playback
Step    APIs    Description    Comments
1    N/A    user starts video playback    
Prerequisites:

user is authenticated with an MVPD

2    API call: Session initialization    the app/player calls CM to initiate a stream    the app/player send all required metadata using information from Adobe Pass Authentication
3    CM responds with decision and streamId    
the policyCompliant json node has value false so the app/player does NOT start playback

4    N/A    
the app/player does NOT start video playback

it displays an error message to the user

N/A
 

 
Description of the API calls
Session initialization call
 

The responsibility of the application developer is to:

Initialize a stream with Concurrency Monitoring before starting video playback
check that the response of the call contains the node policyCompliant with value true
start video playback
